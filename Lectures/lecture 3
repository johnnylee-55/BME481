Quad Tree - partioning an image into quadrants(UR, UL, LR, LL) to homogenize the image
    is the quadrant homogenous? if yes, leave alone. If no, partition that quadrant into another
    4 quadrants and repeat

How can we tell if an image or subimage is homogenous?
    Standard Deviation within an acceptable threshold

1) Establish Quadtree
2) Merge nearby regions

Noise Models
    Guassian
        - mathematically easy to work with, good approximation to other kinds of noise
    Rayleigh
        - magnetic resonance imaging
    Poisson
        - X-ray
    Uniform
        - Quantization noise
    Impulse noise
        - Error in transmission, dead pixels in the detector

Basic Imaging operations
    - Pointwise Operation
        - image normalization
        - image enhancement
            - table lookup
            - Goal: create an image without equally distrubited brightness levels over the whole scale
            Probability Density function, histograms, cumulative density functions

    - Neighborhood Operations
        - interpolation
            - image smoothing / average filter
                - slide a window over an image (a 3x3 window of pixels with the pixel of interest at the center)
                           | 1  1  1 |
                  h =  1/9 | 1  1  1 |
                           | 1  1  1 |
                  averaging filter with no weight

                           | 1  1  1 |
                  h = 1/10 | 1  2  1 |
                           | 1  1  1 |

                           | 1  2  1 |
                  h = 1/16 | 2  4  2 |
                           | 1  2  1 |
                  filters with more weight on the center pixel
                 - windows can vary in size depending on use case
                 - larger matrix = more smoothing
                 - image smoothing degrades the edges in the image
                 - linear method

            - median filtering
                - selects median-value in the pixel neighborhood as a representative
                - non-linear method
                - preserves edges

        - edge detection
            - essentially a derivative operation
            - issues:
                - noise
                - scale
                - scale

            - Done by finding a maximum in the gradient (first derivative) or a change of sign (+/-) in the second derivative (zero-crossing)
                - however, use of zero-crossing can lead to localization errors, edges that should not exist

            - Edges:
                - are typically noisy
                - have varying contrasts along the object
                - occur at different scales
                - may interact when you have two nearby objects

            - Gaussian filters for edge detection
                - weighted more on the middle, and weighted less as distance increases from "center"
                    - this profile is desirable
                - efficient for any n-dimensional signals
                - Optimally, a fitler should have limited support in spatial and frequency domain. 
                - "Nice Scale Behavior"
                - 1D guassian filter
                    g(x) = 1/(sqrt(2pi)σ) * e.exp(-x^2 / 2σ^2)
                    - as signma increases, window size also needs to be increased
                        - σ = 0, window size = 5
                        - σ = 1, window size = 9
                        - σ = 2, window size = 17
                        - using a lower value for σ than optimal leads to blur/round-off errors
                - 2D guassian filter
                    g'(x) (derivative of 1D gaussian)
                    - also known as Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG) filter
                    - LoG ∇^2*G = G(σ1) - G(σ2)
                    - ratio between σ1 and σ2 1.6 found to be ideal
                    - can be reduced to 2 1-dimensional gaussian filters (efficient)
                - used to find magnitude and direction of edges
                    - useful for grouping
                    - can follow contours that are even 1 pixel wide
            - Post Processing
                - ideally, edges are 1 pixel wide
                - thin the edge by finding direction/curve of edge with tangent
                - look into canny edge detection

        - filtering
            real life example: filter out the smokey atmosphere from an image
                - the smoke causes attenuated incident light that is a function of distance
                - convolve the image with a neighrborhood operator 
                
        - Image sharpening and blurring
            convolve an image with a kernal, changing σ value changes effects of different filters
                - Zero-crossing filter
