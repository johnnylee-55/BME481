Image Analysis

2D Projection of 3D world
    - image analysis is intrinsicly ill-posed when solving problems
    - can be somewhat mitigated by applying constraints on possible solutions
Issues
    - spatial distributions of each pixel
    - Dynamic range for each pixel (e.g. 8 bits, 10 bits, 16 bits)
    - Hierarchial representation
    - Compression (.jpeg)
    - abstraction
Rectangular vs Hexagonal Grid
    - distance between a pixel and other pixels in its neighborhood is more consistent in a hexagonal grid
    - rectangular grid is more compact, and most of our technology makes use of rectangular pixels
Neighborhood configuration
    - 4-neighborhood & 8-neighborhood
Representation
    - iconic image
        - histogram and moment-based
    - segmented image
    - geometric image
    - relational model
Chain Code
    - saves space
