Quad Tree - partioning an image into quadrants(UR, UL, LR, LL) to homogenize the image
    is the quadrant homogenous? if yes, leave alone. If no, partition that quadrant into another
    4 quadrants and repeat
How can we tell if an image or subimage is homogenous?
    Standard Deviation within an acceptable threshold

1) Establish Quadtree
2) Merge nearby regions

Noise Models
    Guassian
        - mathematically easy to work with, good approximation to other kinds of noise
    Rayleigh
        - magnetic resonance imaging
    Poisson
        - X-ray
    Uniform
        - Quantization noise
    Impulse noise
        - Error in transmission, dead pixels in the detector

Basic Imaging operations
    - Pointwise Operation
        - image normalization
        - image enhancement
            - table lookup
            - Goal: create an image without equally distrubited brightness levels over the whole scale
            Probability Density function, histograms, cumulative density functions
    - Neighborhood Operations
        - edge detection
        - filtering
