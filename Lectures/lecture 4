Segmenting textures
    Approach
        - Supervised (discriminateive models)
            -
        - Texture feature detectors
            - textures in different orientations
            - Generated how?
                - modulate sigma differently in x and y directions
                - compute a first, 2nd, 3rd derivatives
                - build a large
