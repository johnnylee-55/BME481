CH 2 - The image, it's representations and properties

Visual mis-perception

Similary and gropuping
 - humans tend to group together elements in cluttered scenes by themes that incldue:
    - parallelism
    - symmetry
    - continuity
    - closure

Electromagnetic Spectrum
  - range visible is small cmopared to the entire EMS
  - Violoet: higher resolution (400nm wavelength)
  - Red: higher sensitivity (700nm wavelength)

HSV
  Hue, Saturation, Value
  - expressed in cylindrical coordinates

Human Vision
  - rods: black and white
    - 90 million cells
  - cones: color
    - 4.5 million cells

Animal Vision
  - insects: household fly has fastest response
    - photoreceptors are arranged in groups
    - fast reception
    - mechanical response
  - hawk: high visual acuity, 8x better than human
  - tiger: two eyes, stereo vision
  - rabbit: on sides of head, more coverage
  - bees: can see UV, detect floewrs
